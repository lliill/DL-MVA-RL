# DL-MVA-RL
Deep Learning MVA RL-project.

I used Google colab to finish this mini-project due to local installation problems of Tensorflow. So I did some minor modification on the provided code (save/load in Google drive) to make sure it could be run in colab environment.

All videos and models are saved in the DQN folder.
